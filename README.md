## Abstract
Adverse weather conditions significantly degrade image quality, affecting visual perception and downstream tasks. Traditional methods often employ fixed frequency decomposition patterns, failing to capture distinct frequency characteristics of different weather degradations. We introduce FLASH, a frequency-domain learning network that achieves unified restoration through two core innovations: the Frequency-Driven Histogram Attention (FDHA) mechanism and the No-Activation Frequency Block (NAFB). FDHA revolutionizes attention computation by utilizing frequency domain magnitude distributions, while NAFB serves as a lightweight backbone eliminating traditional activation functions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate FLASH's superiority, achieving 33.21dB average PSNR with a 2.31dB improvement over baselines, while maintaining computational efficiency with only 13M parameters.
