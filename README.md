## Abstract
Adverse weather conditions significantly degrade image quality, affecting visual perception and downstream tasks. Traditional methods often employ fixed frequency decomposition patterns, failing to capture distinct frequency characteristics of different weather degradations. We introduce FLASH, a frequency-domain learning network that achieves unified restoration through two core innovations: the Frequency-Driven Histogram Attention (FDHA) mechanism and the No-Activation Frequency Block (NAFB). FDHA revolutionizes attention computation by utilizing frequency domain magnitude distributions, while NAFB serves as a lightweight backbone eliminating traditional activation functions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate FLASH's superiority, achieving 33.21dB average PSNR with a 2.31dB improvement over baselines, while maintaining computational efficiency with only 13M parameters.

## Overall architecture

Presents the overall architecture of the proposed FLASH network for adverse weather image restoration tasks. The figure illustrates three key components: (a) The complete FLASH architecture employs a U-shaped encoder-decoder design with multiscale feature processing capabilities. The network utilizes NAFB blocks as fundamental building units and integrates FDHA modules at each scale level for frequency domain-guided feature enhancement. Multi-scale auxiliary feature extraction is achieved through progressive downsampling of the original input image, while skip connections facilitate information flow between corresponding levels of the encoder and decoder. (b) The Frequency-Driven Histogram Attention (FDHA) module demonstrates the core innovation of frequency domain-guided feature sorting and dual-branch attention computation. This module processes input features through FFT-based magnitude sorting, followed by parallel BHR and FHR attention calculations, and concludes with cross-attention fusion guided by the original input. (c) The No-Activation Frequency Block (NAFB) presents a lightweight design that eliminates traditional activation functions while maintaining robust feature representation capabilities. The block performs sequential spatial feature extraction through depthwise separable convolution and the SimpleGate mechanism, followed by frequency domain enhancement via the NAFF component. The symbols at the bottom represent concatenation, downsampling, upsampling, element-wise addition, element-wise multiplication, and channel splitting operations, respectively

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiaoq70824/FLASH.git
cd FLASH
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training

### Distributed Training Support
FLASH supports multi-GPU distributed training. All training hyperparameters are defined in the `get_args_parser()` method in `train.py`. If you need to adjust any settings (learning rate, batch size, number of GPUs, etc.), modify the corresponding parameters in that method.

### Quick Start
After setting appropriate hyperparameters, simply run:
```bash
python train.py
```

## Dataset Structure
Organize your training and validation datasets as follows:
```bash
Your_Dataset/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input/     # Degraded weather images
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gt/        # Corresponding ground truth clean images
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ val/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input/     # Validation degraded images  
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gt/        # Validation ground truth images
```

## Dataset Path Configuration
Update the dataset paths in get_args_parser() method:

--train_dataset_path: Path to your training dataset folder
--val_dataset_path: Path to your validation dataset folder
Example:
```
parser.add_argument('--train_dataset_path', default='/your/path/to/train/', type=str)
parser.add_argument('--val_dataset_path', default='/your/path/to/val/', type=str)
```
The training script will automatically handle distributed training, checkpointing, loss logging, and metrics calculation.

## Inference
## Pretrained Weights
The pretrained model weights are available in the weights/ folder:
weights/last.pth - Main pretrained model for all-weather image restoration
## Configuration Setup
Before running inference, update the paths in test_config dictionary in test.py:
Required Paths:
checkpoint_dir: Path to weights folder (default: ./weights)
checkpoint_file: Weight filename (default: last.pth)
checkpoint_file: Weight filename (default: last.pth)
output_dir: Path where restored images will be saved
Example Configuration:
```bash
test_config = {
    'checkpoint_dir': './weights',
    'checkpoint_file': 'last.pth',
    'test_data_dir': '/path/to/your/test/images',
    'output_dir': './results',
    # ... other parameters
}
```
## Input/Output Structure
```bash
test_images/          # Your degraded images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

results/              # Restored images (auto-created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```
## Supported Formats
Input: .jpg, .png, .bmp, .tiff
The script automatically handles image resizing and padding for optimal restoration
## Run Inference
After configuring all paths properly, simply run:
```bash
python test.py
```
The model will process all weather degradations (rain, snow, haze) automatically in a single pass.

### Performance Comparison
FLASH achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for adverse weather image restoration. Our method demonstrates consistent superiority over both specialized single-degradation approaches and unified multi-weather restoration methods.
